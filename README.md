# CNN-on-CIFAR10-Image-Classification
This project demonstrates the application of a 3-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for end-to-end image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.
- **Architecture**: Implements a 3-layer CNN designed for feature extraction and classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, AUROC and Per-Class Accuracy are used to evaluate model performance.

## Highlights
- Processes raw image data using standard normalization and data splitting approaches.
- Achieves competitive classification performance with a carefully designed 3-layer CNN including a dropout rate to deal with the risk of overfitting.
- Includes visualizations of training and validation metrics, such as ROC curve and losses over epochs.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the CNNâ€™s performance:
- **Learning Rates**: Tested values in the set {0.001, 0.01, 0.1}.
- **Batch Sizes**: Evaluated batch sizes of 8, 16, 32 and 64.
- **Number of Convolutional filters**: Experimented with {8, 16, 32}
- **Dropout rate**: Experimented dropout rates of 0.2 and 0.5.

The best configuration achieved a classification accuracy of **90.12%** and an AUROC of **96.02%** on the test set.
